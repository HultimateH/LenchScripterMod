# Lench Scripter Mod
Lua scripting mod for Besiege v0.27

This mod enables the user to control their Besiege machine through the use of Lua scripts. It is designed to run with [Spaar's Mod Loader](http://forum.spiderlinggames.co.uk/forum/main-forum/besiege-early-access/modding/8432-spaar-s-mod-loader-1-3-3-besiege-v0-27). It has similar functionality to that of [Rtbwrrr's](http://forum.spiderlinggames.co.uk/forum/main-forum/besiege-early-access/modding/37479-rbtwrrr-scripter-lachcim-s-scripting-mod-revived-spaar-s-mod-loader-besiege-0-23) or [Lachcim's](http://forum.spiderlinggames.co.uk/forum/main-forum/besiege-early-access/modding/24172-spaar-s-modloader-lachcim-s-scripting-mod-beta-for-besiege-0-10) mod.

It has a new [block identifying system](https://github.com/lench4991/BesiegeScripterMod/wiki/Block-identifiers) and the ability to tune [individual block properties](https://github.com/lench4991/BesiegeScripterMod/wiki/Property-identifiers). It should be compatible with custom and future blocks, however this has not yet been properly tested.

Thanks to [Rbtwrrr](http://forum.spiderlinggames.co.uk/forum/main-forum/besiege-early-access/modding/37479-rbtwrrr-scripter-lachcim-s-scripting-mod-revived-spaar-s-mod-loader-besiege-0-23) for making his source code available and enabling me to continue his work.
